# Bare Bones

Bare Bones is a game submission for Ludum Dare 45. It is a roguelike in which you start with absolutely nothing, no equipment, no clothes, not even your skin.

You are a resurrected adventurer, now a skeleton, and need to find a way out of the dungeon. You will need armor, equipment, and a backpack to hold everything.
